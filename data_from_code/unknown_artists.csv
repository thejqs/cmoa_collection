NOTES: [1] According to Herbert DuPuy, Augusta Hayden's daughter buried this item on the grounds of the Villa Margherita in Charleston, SC to protect it during the Civil War. It was reportedly damaged by shell fire and repaired. [2] The notes indicate that this person's birth name was Otis, which means that this was one of the female children of Nina Augusta Hayden, daughter of Augusta Haden. Nina Augusta married Arthur P. Otis of Charleston, SC on November 26, 1874.They had 5 daughters: Amy, Nina Hayden, Lottie, Maria Wwelsman and Eulia.

NOTES: [1] Correspondence from the estate of Daniel M. Clemson on May 12, 1937 indicates that Clemson purchased this object from Carl W. Hamilton ""approximately 15 years ago"" which would mean Clemson acquired this object in approximately 1922.  However, an appraisal addressed to Carl W.

This coffeepot was once part of a service commissioned around 1755 by a member of the English Ramsay family. The coat of arms was granted to John Ramsey of Southwark in London in 1669. The head of the Ramsay family is the Earl of Dalhousie. It is not known which member of the family ordered the Chinese export porcelain service.

Notes:
[1]. In England by the mid-19th century when restored by F. Leedham, who was active in London c.1830-1860. Possibly in the collection of Miss Rogers, London, England, by 1835 (see Waagen II, p. 269: ""Agnolo Bronzino. Portrait of Leonora di Toledo, wife of Cosimo I., Grand Duke of Tuscany; half the size of life. An admirable work, distinguished from most of the pictures by this master by the transparency and warmth of the flesh tones."") Miss Rogers (Sarah Rogers [1772-1855]) inherited the collection of her brother Henry Rogers in 1833 or 1834; however, she was also a collector herself. In turn, she left the majority of her collection to another brother the poet Samuel Rogers [1763-1855] at her death in January 1855. After his death in December 1855, his collection was sold at auction in April-May 1856 and included the Bronzino portrait (no. 683.)
[2]. It is not yet clear when and how the painting became part of the Huntington collection but it was in his possession by August 1900.
[3]. Collis P. Huntington, in his will, gave his collection of pictures to the Metropolitan Museum of Art with life interest to Arabella Huntington, his second wife and his adopted son, Archer M. Huntington. Arabella married Henry E. Huntington [1850-1927], who was the nephew of Collis P. Huntington, in July 1913. She is referred to as ""Mrs. Henry E. Huntington"" in documents after the marriage. 
[4]. Although life interest in this work was transferred to Archer Huntington from Arabella Huntington after her death, he terminated his life interest in 1925 and gave the work, among others in the original bequest, to the Metropolitan Museum. Specifically, this portrait was no. 36 among the paintings delivered to the Metropolitan Museum of Art from the Collis P. Huntington estate on April 30 and May 1, 1925 (see curatorial file.)
[5]. Metropolitan Museum accession number 25.110.131 (written in red paint on stretcher.)
[6]. As by Antonio Allori (Bronzino); sold for $ 430 (see curatorial file for annotated copy of the sales catalogue.)
